# Coronary-Thrombosis Prediction

## Introduction
Coronary Thrombosis is a type of Cardiovascular Disease(CVD). Unlike most diseases CVDs including Coronary Thrombosis are asymptomatic and hence people have very less knowledge about if they are either prone to it or safe. In this project, we aim to use efficient machine learning method to study the given datasets, visualize it, evaluate it and help the person predict if he has a chance of getting affected by Coronary Thrombosis in the near future. The goal of this research is to predict if the person’s day to day lifestyle might be slowly aiding his body in developing Coronary Thrombosis in the near future by comparing his medical dataset with the dataset library used to train the machine models. Artificial Neural Network trains the model and gives out the best result with the high precision and accuracy.

### Information on the data set
We have collected the sample dataset from Framingham dataset from kaggle .The variables are age, sex, if the person is a current smoker or not, if he is an active smoker, then the number of cigarettes he smokes per day, if he's taking medications for BP on a regular basis, if he’s had stroke previously or had Hypertension previously, if he's a Diabetic person, what's his Cholesterol level, what’s his Systolic Blood Pressure and what’s his Diastolic Blood Pressure and what’s his Body Mass Index, his Heart Rate, his Glucose level and if he has the probability of having Coronary Heart Disease in the next decade, that is upcoming 10 years. This information once collected gets passed on to the model for further processing. The medical dataset is collected from the medical database. We use the Artificial Neural Network for assisting us to help us predict with the help of the given data set whether the patient is likely to get Coronary Thrombosis in the upcoming 10 years or not

### Novelty of work
Along with building an model that predicts coronary thrombosis, we also plan on building an web application with the help of streamlit with additional features along with prediction like suggested diet, recommended yoga, hospital near the patient and few more.

The ultimate aim is to predict if a patient has the chance
of getting Coronary Thrombosis in the upcoming years
or not. To achieve this we use classification techniques
to prepare a machine learning model to detect Coronary
Thrombosis. The first step is the data collection and
assembly. This is the step where we collect the
necessary data set required for training the dataset.But
before we can train the model, we must analyze and
explore the datasets. The dataset has to be preprocessed
before it can be used to train the model. Here comes our
second step, Data Preprocessing.
Data preprocessing is the process where the raw data
given to us is prepared and made suitable for the
machine learning model as it is not always sure that the
data given to us is mandatorily clean and is in an error
free and organized manner. It is a very important stage
as data preprocessing determines the quality of data that
we deal with when we run the model. It also increases
the accuracy and efficiency of a machine learning
model. The cleaner and better the dataset, the better
result we get.
Data preprocessing consists of various steps including
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Integration
3. Data Transformation
4. Data Reduction
Once the preprocessing of data is completed we can now
move on to the next step: Exploratory analysis. In this step
we play around with the data comparing various attributes
against each other. We can also visualize them and get a
better understanding of how each factor is related to each
other, the main factors which act as an important factor in
deciding if the patient might have coronary thrombosis or
not.We can plot graphs and visualize for better comparison
and understanding. We can also remove the unimportant
features from the dataset if we find any are completely
unrelated to the disease.
ANN, Artificial Neural Network is a type of deep
learning method. The ultimate aim of this model is to
mimic the neural networks of the human brain. Just like
how the human brain is networked in an interconnected
way, the artificial neural network follows the same
pattern.They are designed to understand the things and
use their neural networks and make decisions the way a
human would. The neurons in the model keep learning
over time. It consists of three main layers. The first layer
is the input layer where it accepts inputs given to it by
the user. This data is now passed to the hidden layer.
This is where all the calculations happen to figure out the
hidden layer and patterns present within the
information.This could either be a single layer or
multiple layers It goes through various transformations
in this layer. Once the process is done, it results in output
which is given out in the third layer known as output
layer. The key idea is that this algorithm is made in such
a way to resemble the characteristics of a human brain.

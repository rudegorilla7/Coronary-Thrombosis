# Coronary-Thrombosis Prediction

## Introduction
Coronary Thrombosis is a type of Cardiovascular Disease(CVD). Unlike most diseases CVDs including Coronary Thrombosis are asymptomatic and hence people have very less knowledge about if they are either prone to it or safe. In this project, we aim to use efficient machine learning method to study the given datasets, visualize it, evaluate it and help the person predict if he has a chance of getting affected by Coronary Thrombosis in the near future. The goal of this research is to predict if the person’s day to day lifestyle might be slowly aiding his body in developing Coronary Thrombosis in the near future by comparing his medical dataset with the dataset library used to train the machine models. Artificial Neural Network trains the model and gives out the best result with the high precision and accuracy.

### Information on the data set
We have collected the sample dataset from Framingham dataset from kaggle .The variables are age, sex, if the person is a current smoker or not, if he is an active smoker, then the number of cigarettes he smokes per day, if he's taking medications for BP on a regular basis, if he’s had stroke previously or had Hypertension previously, if he's a Diabetic person, what's his Cholesterol level, what’s his Systolic Blood Pressure and what’s his Diastolic Blood Pressure and what’s his Body Mass Index, his Heart Rate, his Glucose level and if he has the probability of having Coronary Heart Disease in the next decade, that is upcoming 10 years. This information once collected gets passed on to the model for further processing. The medical dataset is collected from the medical database. We use the Artificial Neural Network for assisting us to help us predict with the help of the given data set whether the patient is likely to get Coronary Thrombosis in the upcoming 10 years or not

### Novelty of work
Along with building an model that predicts coronary thrombosis, we also plan on building an web application with the help of streamlit with additional features along with prediction like suggested diet, recommended yoga, hospital near the patient and few more.
